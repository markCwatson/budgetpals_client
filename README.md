# budgetpals_client (WIP)

A mobile client for budgetpals. 

Uses the [budgetpals API](https://github.com/markCwatson/budgetpals) (which is WIP).

This app is my first ever attempt at creating a mobile application, and my first time using Flutter/Dart.

# Progress (as of Aug 25, 2023)

Here is the app running in an iOS simulator connected to the budgetpals backend. Only the add account, sign in, and fetch expenses is working so far.
